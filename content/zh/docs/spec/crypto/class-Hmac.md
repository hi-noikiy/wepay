The `Hmac` class is a utility for creating cryptographic HMAC digests. It can
be used in one of two ways:

- As a [stream][] that is both readable and writable, where data is written
  to produce a computed HMAC digest on the readable side, or
- Using the [`hmac.update()`][] and [`hmac.digest()`][] methods to produce the
  computed HMAC digest.

The [`crypto.createHmac()`][] method is used to create `Hmac` instances.
`Hmac` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

Example: Using `Hmac` objects as streams:

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');
const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'a secret');

hmac.on('readable', () => {
  // Only one element is going to be produced by the
  // hash stream.
  const data = hmac.read();
  if (data) {
    console.log(data.toString('hex'));
    // Prints:
    //   7fd04df92f636fd450bc841c9418e5825c17f33ad9c87c518115a45971f7f77e
  }
});

hmac.write('some data to hash');
hmac.end();
```

Example: Using `Hmac` and piped streams:

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');
const fs = require('fs');
const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'a secret');

const input = fs.createReadStream('test.js');
input.pipe(hmac).pipe(process.stdout);
```

Example: Using the [`hmac.update()`][] and [`hmac.digest()`][] methods:

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');
const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'a secret');

hmac.update('some data to hash');
console.log(hmac.digest('hex'));
// Prints:
//   7fd04df92f636fd450bc841c9418e5825c17f33ad9c87c518115a45971f7f77e
```

## `hmac.digest([encoding])`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.1.94
-->

- `encoding` {string} The [encoding][] of the return value.
- Returns: {Buffer | string}

Calculates the HMAC digest of all of the data passed using [`hmac.update()`][].
If `encoding` is
provided a string is returned; otherwise a [`Buffer`][] is returned;

The `Hmac` object can not be used again after `hmac.digest()` has been
called. Multiple calls to `hmac.digest()` will result in an error being thrown.

## `hmac.update(data[, inputEncoding])`

<!-- YAML
added: v0.1.94
changes:
  - version: v6.0.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5522
    description: The default `inputEncoding` changed from `binary` to `utf8`.
-->

- `data` {string | Buffer | TypedArray | DataView}
- `inputEncoding` {string} The [encoding][] of the `data` string.

Updates the `Hmac` content with the given `data`, the encoding of which
is given in `inputEncoding`.
If `encoding` is not provided, and the `data` is a string, an
encoding of `'utf8'` is enforced. If `data` is a [`Buffer`][], `TypedArray`, or
`DataView`, then `inputEncoding` is ignored.

This can be called many times with new data as it is streamed.
