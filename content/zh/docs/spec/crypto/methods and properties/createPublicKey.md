-->

- `key` {Object | string | Buffer | KeyObject}
  - `key`: {string | Buffer}
  - `format`: {string} Must be `'pem'` or `'der'`. **Default:** `'pem'`.
  - `type`: {string} Must be `'pkcs1'` or `'spki'`. This option is required
    only if the `format` is `'der'`.
- Returns: {KeyObject}

Creates and returns a new key object containing a public key. If `key` is a
string or `Buffer`, `format` is assumed to be `'pem'`; if `key` is a `KeyObject`
with type `'private'`, the public key is derived from the given private key;
otherwise, `key` must be an object with the properties described above.

If the format is `'pem'`, the `'key'` may also be an X.509 certificate.

Because public keys can be derived from private keys, a private key may be
passed instead of a public key. In that case, this function behaves as if
[`crypto.createPrivateKey()`][] had been called, except that the type of the
returned `KeyObject` will be `'public'` and that the private key cannot be
extracted from the returned `KeyObject`. Similarly, if a `KeyObject` with type
`'private'` is given, a new `KeyObject` with type `'public'` will be returned
and it will be impossible to extract the private key from the returned object.
