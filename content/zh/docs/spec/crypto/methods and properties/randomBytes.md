    description: Passing `null` as the `callback` argument now throws
                 `ERR_INVALID_CALLBACK`.
-->

- `size` {number}
- `callback` {Function}
  - `err` {Error}
  - `buf` {Buffer}
- Returns: {Buffer} if the `callback` function is not provided.

Generates cryptographically strong pseudo-random data. The `size` argument
is a number indicating the number of bytes to generate.

If a `callback` function is provided, the bytes are generated asynchronously
and the `callback` function is invoked with two arguments: `err` and `buf`.
If an error occurs, `err` will be an `Error` object; otherwise it is `null`. The
`buf` argument is a [`Buffer`][] containing the generated bytes.

```js
// Asynchronous
const crypto = require('crypto');
crypto.randomBytes(256, (err, buf) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(`${buf.length} bytes of random data: ${buf.toString('hex')}`);
});
```

If the `callback` function is not provided, the random bytes are generated
synchronously and returned as a [`Buffer`][]. An error will be thrown if
there is a problem generating the bytes.

```js
// Synchronous
const buf = crypto.randomBytes(256);
console.log(`${buf.length} bytes of random data: ${buf.toString('hex')}`);
```

The `crypto.randomBytes()` method will not complete until there is
sufficient entropy available.
This should normally never take longer than a few milliseconds. The only time
when generating the random bytes may conceivably block for a longer period of
time is right after boot, when the whole system is still low on entropy.

This API uses libuv's threadpool, which can have surprising and
negative performance implications for some applications; see the
[`UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE`][] documentation for more information.

The asynchronous version of `crypto.randomBytes()` is carried out in a single
threadpool request. To minimize threadpool task length variation, partition
large `randomBytes` requests when doing so as part of fulfilling a client
request.
